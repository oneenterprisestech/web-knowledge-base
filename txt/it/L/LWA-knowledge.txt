    -Application of thermal paste
    
      *Put a small dab on a CPU or a GPU and spread it with either something flat or an actual spreader. On a tower, it is recommended to put thermal paste in the            shape of an X, two both corners, then spread it around. This prevents air bubbles more than a circle of thermal paste, and is, therefore, more effecient than          putting it in a circle. On a laptop, thermal paste is applied in a thin line from one side to the other, then spread.

    -Documentation
  
      *Documenting solutions is an extremely important aspect of anything IT related.

      *Documentation is also a highly effective method of sharing ideas and solutions with colleagues and coworker.

     -File types and extensions

       *attrib +h makes a folder or a file hidden.
       *attrib -h removes the hidden attribute.
       *attrib +r adds a read-only attribute
       *rmdir removes an empty directory.
       *rmdir /s removes a directory in spite of having other files within a directory to be removed.
       *xcopy /e copies all files and subdirectories within a directory, including empty directories.
       *xcopy /s copies all files and subdirectories within a directory, however, empty directories are excluded.
       *copy /n copies a single directory with short filenames.
       *copy /v verifies files after a copy operation.
       *md creats a directory or a subdirectory
       *rd removes a directory
       *cd changes the active directory (the directory that you are actively working in)
       *del deletes files and directories.
       *sfc scans the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
